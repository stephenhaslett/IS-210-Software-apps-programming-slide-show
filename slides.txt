Introduction
============

Angry Birds is a game that was developed by Rovio Entertainment and
was first released on the iPhone in 2009. The game features a group
of multi-colored birds whose aim it is to save their eggs from a group
of pigs.

Game Premise
============

A team of birds must save their eggs from a group of enemy green pigs.
The pigs are protected by structures made of various materials such
as wood, glass, ice, rocks, etc.

As the controller of the birds team, it is your job to destroy these
structures and kill the pigs in order to regain your eggs. If you
succeed in your mission, you regain your eggs and move to the next level.

Game Play
=========

Each bird in your team has a unique power that is best suited to destroying
a particular type of structure. For example, blue birds are most effective at
destroying structures made of ice or glass. Yellow birds have the ability to
accelarate and are most effective at destroying wooden structures, whereas an
orange bird, with the ability to inflate and expand, is the bird of choice when
it comes to causing mass destruction.
